# Eye-Movement
## In this website, you'll get to move the black irises of a digital blue website around by simply moving your mouse around.
### How to Run: This exercise is even simpler than the PacMan factory. Simply hover over the web browser window of the HTML file titled "index.html" and you'll be able to move both irises around. You can roll the black spheres around, bounce them, and really drive it to the edge of the white space. However they are confined to that area, so make sure you don't try to click and drag or get the black irises to go outside those limits. Also, they work in tandem, but maybe in a later development of this website, we will play around with not making them move in the same way.
